Project 1: Query-Solver with local LLMs

Objective:
Develop a React-based application that automatically solves database exercises using a
locally running Large Language Model (e.g., Ollama) and evaluates the accuracy of the
generated solutions.
Tasks:
• Build a React frontend for users to input database tasks
• Display the solution generated by the local LLM within the interface
• Develop a Node.js backend to handle communication between the frontend and
the LLM
• Integrate a local LLM (e.g., Ollama) to process and generate solutions
• Implement an evaluation mechanism to assess the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses
